This is just a simple app to check your zodiac sign

you input the date as a string and a number e.g March 17, this will be collected and stored as an array,

the string is then converted to a number and used to determine the month combined with the date and it is displayed on a different screen for the user

simple app of about 5 to 8 functions.....lol you gonna love the minimalistic approach tho
